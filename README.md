# 100Projects
An attempt at the insane list that is https://github.com/aceking007/100ProjectsOfCode. This list seems to have been created as a way to get good at programming, but it looks more like a bucket list to me. I won't be attempting these with any guaranteed frequency, but I hope to chug through them all someday.
